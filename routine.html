        <h2>Daily Ritual – Nourish from Within</h2>
        <p>Feeding your body with wholesome, nutrient-rich foods is key to supporting healthy hair growth. Here’s how I eat to support my hair daily:
        <ul>
            <li>Include soaked nuts and seeds like almonds, walnuts, and chia for essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li>Eat seasonal vegetables such as white pumpkin, spinach, banana stem, and curry leaves for iron, fiber, and hydration.</li>
            <li>Consume protein-rich foods like lentils, dal, boiled eggs, or legumes regularly.</li>
            <li>Add healthy fats from ghee, cold-pressed oils, and Brazil nuts to support scalp health.</li>
            <li>Incorporate natural sources of vitamin C like amla, figs, and prunes for collagen production and hair strength.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated with herbal teas, coconut water, or plain water throughout the day.</li>
        </ul> I include fruits, nuts, seeds, and herbs in my daily diet to nourish my hair from within.</p>
